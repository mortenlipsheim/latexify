# **App Name**: Latexify

## Core Features:

- Formula Recognition: Use generative AI to process an image of a mathematical formula and produce corresponding LaTeX code. The AI model acts as a tool, recognizing elements within the image to construct the appropriate code.
- Code Display: Display the recognized LaTeX code in a text area that allows to view and edit the formula.
- Copy to Clipboard: Enable copying the LaTeX code to the clipboard with a single tap for easy pasting into other applications.
- Share Code: Allow users to share the LaTeX code directly to other apps on their device via the share sheet.
- Custom Formatting: Provide a settings panel where users can define custom formatting codes (e.g., '$$' before and after the formula) to be automatically applied.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated blue (#4285F4) to reflect precision and clarity, essential for a scientific tool.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5) to provide a neutral backdrop that reduces eye strain during extended use.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#FF5722) for interactive elements like buttons, drawing attention to actionable areas.
- Use a monospace font for the LaTeX code display to ensure each character's width is uniform, enhancing readability.
- Employ minimalistic, geometric icons for key functions (copy, share, settings) to maintain a clean and focused user interface.
- Implement a simple, single-column layout that places primary focus on the formula image and LaTeX code, ensuring ease of use and quick access to main functions.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for feedback on user actions, such as a brief highlight on the copy button when the code is copied, providing clear acknowledgement.
